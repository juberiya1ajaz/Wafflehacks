# Soldiers' Shelter

Virtual Home for all the soldiers that have gone through rape and abuse

## 💡 Inspiration

When do you think of a domestic violence survivor, who comes to mind? For most people, it’s a female. And rightfully so since three-quarters of domestic violence victims are women. Data from the National Crime Victimization Study between 2003 and 2012 show that men account for about 24 percent of domestic violence survivors. Hundreds of thousands of men experience domestic violence each year, too.
However, there is Higher victimization for males than females. In rape cases, the victimization of women is at its peak. Many males never come forward even after being domestically abused for a long duration because of fear of getting victimized.
These people are not just survivors, they are soldiers who keep going and are still surviving even though they have seen the worst in their life. They are living despite it all. Overcoming abuse does not come easily it takes a helping hand and positive steps every day.
To help them, we have developed **Soldiers' shelter** to help them to come forward so that, every voice be heard despite their gender. On Soldiers' shelter, they can talk anonymously with fellow soldiers and can give a helping hand to each other without being judged.

- Tailwind: For styling and animations

## Best Diversity & Inclusion Hack

## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using **Hedera’s testnet** to **deploy smart contracts** for our app. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project under given time frame.
- Deploying smart contract on Hedera.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are pleased that we managed our time and completed our task swiftly and on time.
- Learning bare bones of MERN in just 24 hours.

## 📖 What we learned

- Implementation of DeSo.
- Collaboration with other developers.
- How MERN stack works and how we can use it to make efficient websites.

## 🚀 What's next for ShareNcare
- We aim to develop this platform and collaborate with Universities to make it a genuine free product that benefits everyone and introduces new features and other enhancements.
- Deploying the web app.
